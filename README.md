# t_chess
This program plays beginner level chess.  It currently runs on a Teensy 3.6 but I believe the only issue one may have with running on other Arduino type hardware would be with the ElapsedMillis object.

Currently the game play is via the serial monitor.  I plan to add some graphics for the 320 by 240 display in the future.
